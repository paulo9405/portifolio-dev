## Page Structure

The Skills page is organized into 6 sections:

### 1. Hero Section
- Title: "Skills & Experience"
- Subtitle: Focus on full-stack with Python, Django, React, PostgreSQL
- Emphasis: Backend architecture and solving real operational problems

### 2. Core Technologies
**Focus:** Main tech stack with practical context

**Two-column layout:**

**Backend:**
- Python (primary language, business logic, API development)
- Django & Django REST Framework (ORM, auth, permissions, production)
- PostgreSQL (schema design, queries, data integrity)

**Frontend:**
- JavaScript / TypeScript (ES6+, type safety)
- React (component architecture, state management)
- Next.js (SSR, App Router)
- Tailwind CSS (utility-first, responsive layouts)

**Tone:** Practical descriptions, not just listing tools

### 3. What I Build
**Focus:** Types of systems and specializations

**4 Key Areas:**
1. **Management Systems** - Complete business platforms (barbershop example)
2. **Custom Delivery Platforms** - Order management (açaí example)
3. **REST APIs** - Backend APIs with Django REST Framework
4. **Data Processing & Reporting** - Business data, automated reports

Each includes real project examples

**Tone:** Specific capabilities backed by actual projects

### 4. Technical Skills
**Focus:** Skills beyond languages/frameworks

**6 Category Grid:**
1. **Architecture** - REST API design, database schema, modular systems, RBAC
2. **Backend** - Django ORM, authentication, data validation, transactions
3. **Frontend** - Component architecture, state management, responsive design
4. **Database** - PostgreSQL queries, schema design, data integrity, migrations
5. **Development** - Git, documentation, debugging, deployment
6. **Business** - Requirements gathering, workflow analysis, user feedback, domain understanding

**Tone:** Organized, comprehensive skill overview

### 5. How I Work
**Focus:** Development philosophy and approach

**5 Key Principles:**
1. **Problem-first** - Understand operational problem before technical solution
2. **Full-stack ownership** - Control entire system to optimize workflow
3. **Readable code** - Write for other developers, clear naming, documentation
4. **User conversations** - Talk to users, feedback beats assumptions
5. **Production reliability** - Data validation, error handling, backups matter

**Tone:** Mature, experience-based perspective

### 6. What I'm Looking For
**Focus:** Opportunities and team fit

Key points:
- Backend-heavy projects, full-stack products
- Operational systems, data processing
- Teams that care about users, not just features
- Quality > speed
- Call-to-action: "Let's Talk" button

**Tone:** Clear about what you want, professional

## Content Strategy

### Honesty About Experience Level
- Shows real technologies used in production
- References actual projects built
- Doesn't claim expertise in unused technologies
- Focus on depth (Django, React, PostgreSQL) over breadth

### Evidence-Based Claims
- Every skill backed by project example
- "I build management systems" → barbershop project
- "I build delivery platforms" → açaí project
- "I write readable code" → explained in philosophy

### Practical Over Theoretical
- Not just listing technologies
- Explains what you've built with them
- Shows understanding of why they matter
- Demonstrates production experience

### Senior-Level Perspective
- "How I Work" section shows maturity
- Problem-first approach
- User-focused development
- Production reliability emphasis
- Domain understanding priority
