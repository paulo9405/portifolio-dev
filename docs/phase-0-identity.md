## 2. Short Bio

I'm Paulo Gomes, a Brazilian full-stack developer based in Ireland. I build software for real businesses facing real problems. When my mother's chronic pain made handwriting delivery orders nearly impossible, I built a custom platform so she could keep working. I also created a complete management system for the largest barbershop in Buritizeiro, MG—handling everything from scheduling to cash flow. I specialize in turning messy manual processes into clean, functional systems. The kind that people actually use every day.

## 3. Positioning Statement

I'm a full-stack developer who helps small businesses eliminate operational friction. I build end-to-end systems—from backend architecture to user-facing interfaces—that reduce manual work and solve concrete problems. My clients aren't abstract use cases. They're people running real operations who need software that actually works.

## 4. Writing Rules for Your Portfolio

**To keep your portfolio sounding human:**

- Write like you're explaining your work to another developer, not selling it
- Use short sentences mixed with longer ones—no uniform patterns
- Drop the marketing speak: avoid "seamless," "empower," "unlock"
- Be specific: mention actual features, not vague capabilities
- Show the problem before the solution
- If a sentence sounds like it could be on any tech website, rewrite it
- Read it out loud—if it sounds robotic, it is

## Next Steps

Move to **Phase 1: Portfolio Architecture** to define the technical structure.
